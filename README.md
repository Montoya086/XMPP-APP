* @xmpp/client and @xmpp/debug: For implementing XMPP protocol-based communication.
* formik and yup: For handling forms and validation.
* react-native-svg: For rendering SVG images in the app.

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure to complete the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) instructions, before proceeding. This is necessary for launching react-native apps.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of the project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of the project. Run the following command to start the _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see the app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run the app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively. This can be made by opening in the respective Android/IOS folder.
